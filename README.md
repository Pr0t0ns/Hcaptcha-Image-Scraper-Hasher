## NOTES ##

If anyone want's to create a PR to improve my code feel free to just please do not pr anything that requires python-ghost-cursor module because it's trash.
I would appreciate if someone could fix my mouse movement though because mine is very bad atm. Also It would be cool if someone can fix my headers so it matches the browser type so it can produce Higher Quality Images.
